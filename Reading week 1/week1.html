			This was our first reading discussion post called Tool Standards and Poetics. We we tasked to read the articles and write a written response to the questions provided. Here is my response to the questions.
			<div></div>
	The two articles both articulate an ethical problem related to their topic (industry-standard design tools & the current scale and state of the internet). Define what you consider to be the author's positions in relation to these two topics and how they overlap.
<div></div>
Throughout these two articles “The Programmed Designer” by John-Patrick Hartnett and “The Internet’s Back-to-the-Land Movement” by Becca Abbe, these articles both begin to share the same opinions on how little control these vast networks or softwares offer us; as individuals to build or create on. 
<div></div>
Do they suggest solutions? If so, how do those solutions relate to the other article?
<div></div>
In “The Programmed Designer” by John-Patrick Hartnett, he mentions a software that could be a potential solution; Hartnett goes on to say Jürg Lehni and Jonathan Puckey’s software called Paper.js, is a framework that "was created to counter such ignorance of the functionality of technological tools." 

In “The Internet’s Back-to-the-Land Movement” by Becca Abbe, she mentions a solution in which reversing the growth of the human population could be a potential answer to living a healthier lifestyle in which it expands humanity's growth and activity. Becca Abbe writes “ reducing birth rates and shifting attention to agriculture over industry.." 

Abbe then concludes her article by suggesting the options we have as individuals "As we come to realize that even our digital growth has its limits, we’re once again faced with a choice: stay within the strictures of existing structures, or go off-grid and build our own."
<div></div>
Aside from the mastery of certain digital tools and programs, what skills do you see as integral to your graphic design practice?
<div></div>
One skill I believe to be integral to my graphic design practice is to stay curious, I think by staying curious and learning more from this industry really helps your involvement not just as a graphic designer but a designer, in general.
