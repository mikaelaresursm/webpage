			This was our second reading discussion post called Olia Lialina — Turing Complete User & Laurel Schwulst — My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge... We we tasked to read the articles and write a written response to the questions provided. Here is my response to the questions.
			<div></div>
			What do you think of Lialina’s definition of the universal user? 
			<div></div>
			I think Lialina’s definition of the Universal User is an important definition to understand, as it separates the old notion of Users not being able to interact with their personal computers. However, this new idea or notion that Lialina introduces, brings the User to interact with their computers and the web, without becoming that dreadful invisible user sitting behind their invisible computer. This Universal User is a user that has the ability and capability to achieve their goals regardless of whatever app or device their using. This is exactly what Laurel Schwulst’s argument is advocating; that users should build a website not just to promote or build a business, but to create their own space! For example, you could write a blog about how much you love ice cream, you could add or delete pictures of ice cream pictures if you wanted, and document every single ice cream flavour you like. It is this ability a user can have, instead of using one application that restricts them like Instagram, Facebook, or Tumblr. 
			<div></div>
			What kind of computer user are you?
			<div></div>
			I am honestly an invisible user, and it is probably because of how I was introduced to this product and many others. As I use many Apple products like my Mac and iPhone, it was interesting to see how they convey the idea of invisibility. In Lialina’s article she quotes Apple’s statement: “We believe that technology is at its very best when it is invisible when you are conscious only of what you are doing, not the device you are doing it with […] iPad is the perfect expression of that idea, it’s just this magical pane of glass that can become anything you want it to be. It’s a more personal experience with technology than people have ever had.”
			In this statement Apple is talking about the iPad but, in reality, it isn’t just the iPad that follows this idea. Many Apple products follow this notion of invisibility as it continues to treat the user… as just a user; giving no ability for the user to truly interact with the device. A perfect example would be, the different softwares you’re unable to use because you have a Mac. As a Mac user, I can’t download a lot of games or softwares because they’re pc compatible and not Mac. Or the fact that if I got an Android phone and with a Mac laptop, I wouldn’t be able to sync messages, emails or photos, just because I had a different interface. This poor structure that Apple has created, inhibits the notion of becoming an invisible user.
