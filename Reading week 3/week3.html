			This was our third reading discussion post called Code, letters, logic, play. We we tasked to watch and read the articles and write a written response to the question provided. Here is my response to the question.
			<div></div>
			Van Rossum explores the visual, formal, and structural logic of older programmatic-looking artworks (pre-computer) in order to remake in current day languages (Python) and tools (Drawbot), because why not? By rethinking these static artworks into motion that loops, JVR re-observes through the lens of new tools and languages. The artwork takes on a new life, and can delight in different ways. Find 1 example of design that you find fascinating and are confused as to how it was made. Post a visual. Describe how you think it was made. Then find out how it actually was, written in point form. Make sure to cite!

			A design that I found fascinating was this motion graphic created by artist Lulu xXX. This looping motion graphic featured a movie clip ‘black swan,’ and captured one of Natalie Portman’s scenes in the movie. I found this design to be complex by the way the artist uses this digital code style to literally illustrate the scene. Throughout this graphic, you can see multiple tiny coloured letters and symbols, as it creates this mosaic pattern throughout the design. I honestly never seen a design like this, so I was perplexed on how this artist created it; my first thought would be coding as it did feature this digital code style. But after doing some research I did find that this artist Lulu xXX, is a generative designer who uses AI-powered software to create their many designs. I ended up not finding exactly how she made this design but; In an article called ‘9 generative designers to draw inspiration from’ artist Lulu xXX was featured and revealed how she creates her design pieces, Lombardo writes: “Lulu xXX creates vibrant, astounding, and often intimate works that weave AI and digital experimentation into thought-provoking statements on beauty and feminine iconography. The artist uses optical flow analysis tools to capture motion from moving footage and manipulates still digital images and motion sequences in a transformative/generative way. They also build and use their own tools using open-sourced and custom code” (Lombardo, 2022).
