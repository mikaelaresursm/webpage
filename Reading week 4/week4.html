			This was our fourth and final reading discussion post called In Free Fall, Hito Steyerl. We were tasked to read the article and write a written response to the question provided. Here is my response to the question.
			<div></div>			
			A major theme that runs throughout Steyerl’s essay is that of surveillance. In your own words, define surveillance and discuss how the notion of a “vertical” or aerial perspective lends itself to a culture of surveillance according to Steyerl’s thought experiment.  
			<div></div>
			The definition of surveillance is the concept of being watched or monitored. In Steyerl’s thought experiment, she discusses the notion of a “vertical” or aerial perspective and relates it to a culture of surveillance. In Steyerl’s thought experiment she discusses that in visual art the perspective of horizontality is now being supplemented by verticality; meaning, it now consists of a multitude of aerial surveillance images; like the app google maps or google earth representations and even drone perspectives. It is this kind of new perspective of this omniscient aerial view that brings this kind of view a God’s eye view or a “new view from above”, as it then projects delusions of stability and safety onto us. As this aerial imagery creates this illusionary tool that the orientation of the horizons has been shattered and that time is out of the joint and we no longer know if we are the subjects or objects, as we continue to spiral down an unnoticeable free fall.
